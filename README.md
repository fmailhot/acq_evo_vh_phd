# Modeling the Acquisition and Evolution of vowel harmony

This is code from my grad school research (ca. 2008-2010). The writing/ directory has a conference paper and my thesis.

The project was twofold:

- simulate the acquisition of [vowel harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_harmony) using simplifies (but representative) data in a memory-based learner ([LIbPhon.py](LIbPhon.py)). See [acq_model.py](acq_model.py) for the main driver script.
- examine the emergence of vowel harmony in a multi-agent model. See [change_model.py](change_model.py) for the main driver script.
